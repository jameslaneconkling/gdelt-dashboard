Mapping Syria Conflict Density
==============
[see the map on gh pages](http://jameslaneconkling.github.io/gdelt-dashboard/)

All conflict data is derived from the [GDELT Project](http://gdeltproject.org/).

Map Data is from [OSM](osm.org).  Cartography is based off the OSMBright template by [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/osm-bright-mac-quickstart/), using MapBox Studio for the base layer and leaflet.js to load and style the geojsons.

See [pydelt repo](https://github.com/jameslaneconkling/pydelt) for GDELT data munging tools and sample script.
