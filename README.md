Mapping Syria Conflict Density
==============
### [PROJECT](http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49790262/syria_site/index.html)

All conflict data is derived from the [GDELT Project](http://gdeltproject.org/).

Map Data is from [OSM](osm.org).  Cartography is based off the OSMBright template by [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/osm-bright-mac-quickstart/).

See [pydelt repo](https://github.com/jameslaneconkling/pydelt) for GDELT data munging tools and sample script.
